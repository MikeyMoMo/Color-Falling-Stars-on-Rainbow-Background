# Color-Falling-Stars-on-Rainbow-Background
From the original Adafruit monochrome falling stars comes color stars on a color background.

I thought I could do it one better so I did.  Here is color stars on a color background.  There were some silly problems along the way like when the random function started taking 19 seconds to return a value.  But all is worked out now.  (I never figured out what caused the random generator to take so long.  This is the second time I have encountered this problem) 

It has been converted to a sprite to reduce the remaining flickering.  I started this years ago and it was start and stop many times.  I finally went back to it and finished.  I hope you like it.  Comments and code suggestions welcomed.  I don't snarl and block people (like some other authors do) when suggestions or bugs are reported.  I like to improve code whenever I can.

5/5/2023 -- Now with 5 different background color generators, just for variety.  Many other little tweaks to make it really "right".  Enjoy.
