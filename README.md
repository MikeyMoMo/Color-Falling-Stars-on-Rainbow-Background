# Color-Falling-Stars-on-Rainbow-Background
From the original Adafruit monochrome falling stars comes color stars on a color background

I thought I could do it one better so I did.  Here is color stars on a color background.  There were some silly problems along the way like when the random function started taking 19 seconds to return a value.  But all is worked out now.  I hope to convert this to a canvas or sprite to reduce the remaining flickering.  Soon, I hope.
